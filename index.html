    <h2>Why Queenstown?</h2>
    <h3>Queenstown, the Adventure Capital of the World</h3>
    <p>Staggering beauty and heart-pumping thrills await in the resort town of Queenstown, which is also known for its Hobbits—much of the Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed in the area. </p>
    <p>Outdoor enthusiasts come here for the kayaking, bungee jumping, jetboating, white-water rafting, hiking, and skiing. More mild-mannered adventurers can take a quiet cruise through nearby Milford Sound, part of the Fiordland National Park World Heritage area, or sample South Island pinot noir from one of the region's 75 wineries.</p>

            <h4>Nevis bungy</h4>
            <p>
                Go full throttle with our 134m bungy (the highest in New Zealand). It’s 8.5 seconds in a blitz of pure fear and adrenaline. Don’t say we didn’t warn you, because this will definitely put the cement in your coffee.

            <h5>How did others view the experience?</h5>
            <p>"What an amazing experience, Nevis Bungy was on my bucket list I never thought I would have the courage to actually jump.
                I have to be honest I was terrified when it was my turn to jump, the team were so supportive and patient and yes I completed the jump.
                Once I jumped the experience was the biggest adrenaline rush. I am so proud of myself and am looking forward to doing it again."</p>

                    <h4>Whitewater rafting</h4>
                    <p>
                        Whitewater rafting is one of the best extreme experiences in the adventure capital of New Zealand and we intend to keep it that way. Raft where the jet boats fear to go and prepare to take a rapid in the face as you hold on during an epic paddle experience.

                    <p>"That probably was the best adventure I’ve ever had with the family so far. Simon was amazing driver & water rafter. Such a talented guy!  Claudia was super friendly & a very competent guide. I highly recommend them for anyone who wants to get an unforgettable joyful family adventure :)"</p>
